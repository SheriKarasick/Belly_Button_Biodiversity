# Exploring Data with an Interactive Dashboard. 

## Summary
This project explored the biodiversity of bacteria in belly button samples.  The end product reflects an integration of JavaScript code with Plot.ly to create interactive graphics supporting visualization of the individual samples in the data.  After creating the JavaScript plot script, the charts were styled in an html page and posted to GitHub's public pages repository.
